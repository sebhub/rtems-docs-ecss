Introduction
************

The *${.:/component/package-long}* or shorter ${.:/component/package-short}
provides you with a comprehensive set of tools, libraries, header files,
sources, and documentation to build applications using the :term:`RTEMS`
real-time operating system.
${.:/push-enabled-by:pkg.feature.qual}
Some components are pre-qualified for use in criticality category B systems
according to ${/glossary/ecss:/term} standards for software products
(${/ref/ecss/e-st-40c:/cite-long} and ${/ref/ecss/q-st-80c-r1:/cite-long}).
${.:/pop-enabled-by}

The package is shipped in the separate archive file
:file:`${.:/input/archive/file:basename}` [#f1]_.  Please read the
:ref:`GettingStarted` section before you unpack this archive.
${.:/push-enabled-by:and: [pkg.feature.qual, pkg.arch.sparc]}
You may obtain this document and the package from the following ESA web site:
`https://rtems-qual.io.esa.int/ <https://rtems-qual.io.esa.int/>`_.
${.:/pop-enabled-by}

The :ref:`ECSSSoftwareDocumentation`, :ref:`TechNotes`, :ref:`RTEMSDocs` and
:ref:`FormalMethods` sections give you a structured overview and quick access
to all documents of the package.

For help to migrate existing applications from a previous RTEMS version to the
RTEMS version delivered by the package, see the :ref:`Migration`.
${.:/push-enabled-by:pkg.feature.qual}
Migrating applications and a qualification according to ECSS standards is a complex task,
especially if you migrate also from a uniprocessor system to an
${/glossary/smp:/term} system.  For ${/glossary/qdp:/plural} and related
activities, service and maintenance is provided by embedded brains, see also
:ref:`Service`.

:ref:`MissionQualification` is provided in a dedicated section, describing the
necessary steps to qualify components of the package for the hardware platform
of the package user.
